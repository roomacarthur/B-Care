## AKA Roo

Started PP4 back in August but then had to take a big break from the course, I've just returned and have done 0 code work since august. I have a very good understanding of HTML & CSS and a reasonable understanding of Python and JS. I've well and truly fallen in love with django and can't wait tog et stuck in. I'm working a lot at the moment helping my mother with her businesses as she is unwell. I will struggle to put aside a certain block of time for the hackathon but when I'm about im 100%.
